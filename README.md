# Experimento

This projects aims at designing an experimentation service, which will then be used to perform various tests in any kind of application.  

## Concepts

Experimento was designed to be highly extensible and customizable. We want to have everything decouples in such a way that will allow us to easily swap components. 
We recommend that you follow a microservice oriented architecture while implementing the interfaces required.
